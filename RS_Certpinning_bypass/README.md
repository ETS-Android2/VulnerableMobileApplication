# RS_Certpinning_bypass - Android Mobile Application

Certificate Pinning is an advanced certificate trust mechanism which enables the client-side application to validate provided certificates. This means the mobile application only trusts its own stored certificates and rejects untrustworthy certificates, even the certificates in the mobile deviceâ€™s trust store.

Most mobile application's today has some form of certificate pinning enabled. This application could be used to learn how to bypass common certificate pinning with the help of Frida tools.

This application was created as part of Redshift mobile training series that will soon be posted on Redshift YouTube channel. In this training series we will go over how to sucessfully exploit this application with the help of Objection.
